I recently was given a task at work to encrypt / decrpyt files using PGP.  I had never even heard of PGP so I thought it would make a good blog post.

1. What is PGP?

PGP literally stands for Pretty Good Privacy.  The name is not exactly inspiring but it is widely used to encrypt sensitive files and messages. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy>
