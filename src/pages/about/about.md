Hi my name is Matt Horrall. This blog is about my adventures in coding. I will try to post about things that I am working on and do not want to forget, or things that inspire me.

I have been working professionally in IT since 2004. 12 of those years I spent as an IT Manager / Developer for an automotive component manufacturer. I wrote my first basic webpage in the late 90s while in high school and started desktop development with VB6. Not long after I moved into .Net and couldn't stop. In 2016 I made the transition to a full-time developer role and I haven't looked back. My background in dealing with many technologies has definite benefits but my passion is code!

If you are reading this, I hope that you have found something that I posted useful. Feel free to reach out if you have a question.
